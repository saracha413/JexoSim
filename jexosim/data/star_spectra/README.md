Can put external star spectra in this folder.  
File must be a .txt file.
First column must have wavelength in microns
Second column must have flux density in W/m2/um
No column headers should be used.
To use external non-database files, enter 'file' for the option 'star_spectrum_model' in the input parameters file.
If the file is in this folder, there is no need to put the full file path under 'star_spectrum_file' in the input parameters file; you can just enter the file name, e.g. 'HD209.txt'
